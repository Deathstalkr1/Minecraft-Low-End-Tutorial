# How to get minecraft 1.19.2 to run decently on your low-end PC.
A guide by Deathstalkr1

## STAGE 1: INITIAL INSTALL.

# Step 1: Install Fabric and fabric API. This is required to run the performance enhancing mods on your PC at all. First install fabric and then drag the fabric API jar file to your mods folder, which I go into in the next step.

# Step 2: Install performance-enhancing mods. There are hyperlinks below that are direct download links for Sodium, Lithium, Phosphor, Essential, FerriteCore, and the optional Iris Shaders mod. Sodium is a fabric replacement for optifine, and it runs significantly better. Lithium and Phosphor is for server and lighting performance respectively. Essential adds friends lists, DMs, and allows you to direct connect to your friend's world without port-fowarding. FerriteCore is for memory, it often halves the memory usage for minecraft. Once you've downloaded these mods and installed fabric, go to your mods folder, depending on what platform you're on it's `%appdata$/roaming/.minecraft` on windows, `/home/YOURUSERNAME/.minecraft` on linux. If you're using the flatpak version of minecraft on linux then it's in `/home/YOURUSERNAME/.var/app/com.mojang.Minecraft/.minecraft/`.
